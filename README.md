# US Tariff Shocks – DID and Firm-Level Panel Regression

This repository contains the empirical implementation of the 
Difference-in-Differences (DID) and firm-level panel regression 
analysis used in the research paper examining the impact of 
U.S. tariff shocks on Indian firms.

## Objective
To identify the causal effect of U.S. tariff increases on:
- Firm-level revenue
- Export intensity
- Profitability
- Sectoral performance

## Methodology

1. Difference-in-Differences (DID)
   - Treatment: Firms exposed to U.S. tariff-affected sectors
   - Control: Non-exposed firms
   - Pre- and post-tariff comparison

2. Firm-Level Panel Regression
   - Fixed effects estimation
   - Time and firm controls
   - Robust standard errors

## Data
- Firm-level financial data
- Sectoral tariff exposure measures
- Time-series panel structure

## Output
- Causal estimates of tariff exposure
- Regression tables used in the paper
- Robustness checks

All results are fully reproducible using the notebook provided.
